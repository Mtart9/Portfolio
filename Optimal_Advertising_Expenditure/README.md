# Optimal Advertising Expenditure

This repository contains a mathematical modeling project focused on determining optimal advertising expenditure across different media channels. The objective was to minimize overall cost while achieving a target level of audience exposure.

## 📝 Project Summary

The project involved:

- Constructing a linear optimization model using Maple to allocate advertising budgets efficiently.
- Formulating constraints based on exposure goals and media limitations.
- Conducting **sensitivity analysis** and **shadow price evaluation** to assess model robustness.
- Presenting results and visualizations in LaTeX.

This work was published in the **Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics, Volume 434 (2023)**.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Maple
- LaTeX

## 📂 Files Included

- `OptimalAdvertisingExpenditure_Proc_COSC2022-1.pdf` # Final paper

## 📌 Highlights

- Developed an optimal control model using the Maximum Principle to determine profit-maximizing advertising strategies across a product's life cycle.
- Used Maple to solve the system of necessary conditions for optimality and perform sensitivity analysis on the advertisement return rate.
- Found that an initially moderate advertising strategy—followed by a gradual increase—was most effective early in a product's lifespan.
- Demonstrated that as market saturation occurs and competition increases, the cost-effectiveness of advertising declines sharply.
- Showed that reducing advertising spend near the end of a product’s life cycle is necessary to maintain profitability.
- Provided real-world business insights applicable to dynamic markets such as electronics, where firms must continually innovate and phase out promotion of older models.
