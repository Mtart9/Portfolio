# Optimal Advertising Expenditure

This repository contains a mathematical modeling project focused on determining optimal advertising expenditure across different media channels. The objective was to minimize overall cost while achieving a target level of audience exposure.

## 📝 Project Summary

The project involved:

- Constructing a linear optimization model using Maple to allocate advertising budgets efficiently.
- Formulating constraints based on exposure goals and media limitations.
- Conducting **sensitivity analysis** and **shadow price evaluation** to assess model robustness.
- Presenting results and visualizations in LaTeX.

This work was published in the **Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics, Volume 434 (2023)**.
