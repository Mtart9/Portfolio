📊 Multiple Regression Computing in R

This project applies multiple linear regression techniques to investigate the relationships between a continuous response variable and several predictors. It involves model selection, diagnostic checking, multicollinearity analysis, and interpretation of results using R.
📈 Project Overview

-Goal: Build, evaluate, and interpret a multiple regression model
-Method: Linear regression with backward/forward selection and diagnostics
-Tools Used: R, RMarkdown
-Data: Provided as part of an academic project

🛠️ Features

-Full regression modeling workflow in R
-Variable selection using AIC and BIC criteria
-Multicollinearity analysis using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)
-Diagnostic plots including:
    -Residual vs. Fitted
    -Q-Q plots
-Nested model comparison via ANOVA

📈 Model Insights

-Identified and removed redundant predictors
-Final model met all regression assumptions
-Demonstrated the importance of checking for leverage and influence points
-Clear interpretation of coefficient significance and direction
