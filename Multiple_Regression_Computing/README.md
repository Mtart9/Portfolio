📈 Multiple Regression Computing – Michael Tartamella

This project explores the construction, evaluation, and interpretation of multiple regression models using R. Through model selection, diagnostic checking, and multicollinearity analysis, the objective is to develop the most effective and statistically sound model to predict a continuous outcome variable.
🧠 Project Summary

This analysis investigates how multiple predictors influence a response variable. The project follows a structured regression workflow that includes:

    Fitting initial full and reduced models

    Performing variable selection using AIC and BIC

    Conducting multicollinearity checks using VIF

    Evaluating model assumptions with residual and leverage plots

    Comparing nested models via ANOVA

🔍 Techniques Used

    Multiple Linear Regression

    Backward and Forward Selection (AIC/BIC)

    Model Diagnostics (Residual plots, leverage, Cook’s distance)

    Multicollinearity Analysis (VIF)

    Nested Model Comparison (ANOVA)

📦 Technologies

    Language: R

    Libraries: car, MASS, ggplot2, dplyr, GGally, leaps

📌 Key Insights

    Identified statistically significant predictors using model selection criteria.

    Detected and addressed multicollinearity through VIF analysis.

    Final model provided interpretable coefficients and satisfied key model assumptions.

    Diagnostic plots supported the robustness of the selected model.
